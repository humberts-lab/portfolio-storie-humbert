Our project's target audience is older adults with limited experience using technology. The project is especially beneficial for residents of nursing homes, but it can also assist others. This project explains what phishing is and teaches how to recognize when someone is attempting a phishing attack. It identifies warning signs in emails, texts, and other messages, and describes steps to take if you suspect an attack. It has examples of phishing and an educated graph of the population's ages of those who fall for these attacks.
