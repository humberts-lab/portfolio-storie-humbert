**About Me**

My name is Storie Humbert. I am interested in this field because I want to learn more about computers and understand how people get hacked, as well as how to help defend against them. I graduated from Lancaster High School in 2025, having completed the essential coding and robotics classes. I was originally adopted from China at a very young age. My interests are baking, cooking, gaming, and music. At the moment, I work at Texas Roadhouse with no experience in other computer-related fields.
