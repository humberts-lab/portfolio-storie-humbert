The community I selected is a nursing home, which provides long-term care and daily assistance to elderly residents. Nursing homes manage highly sensitive information such as medical histories, financial records, and personal identification details. Because of this, cybersecurity awareness is essential. A single security incident could compromise residents' private data, damage the facility's reputation, and even interfere with the delivery of medical services.

Cybersecurity awareness is especially important for staff members who interact with electronic health records and internal communication systems on a daily basis. Nursing homes are frequent targets for phishing attempts, ransomware attacks, and other threats due to the high value of healthcare data. If employees are not properly trained, they may unintentionally expose the organization to these risks.

To address these concerns, training materials for nursing home staff should be clear, practical, and specific to healthcare environments. Training can include identifying suspicious emails, using strong passwords,  following the proper procedures for handling real-world examples, and visual reminders would help the staff retain information while balancing their busy schedules. By tailoring cybersecurity awareness to the unique needs of a nursing home, the organization can strengthen data protection, maintain trust with residents and families, and ensure uninterrupted quality of care.
