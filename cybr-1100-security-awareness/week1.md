# Week 1 â€“ Introduction to Security Awareness
 
**Description:**  
This week, we went over how to log into all the websites we are going to be using during the classes. We did module 1 of Intro to cybersecurity, Cisco I-Intro to networks, and Computer Hardware and OP System in Netacad. And read chapter one of Ciampa, Security Awareness: Applying Practical Security in Your World, 6e.

**Summary:**
I learned that there are 7 types of threat actors: some attackers help companies identify weaknesses for payment, some seek personal or financial gain, others work on behalf of governments, and some aim only to scare individuals without any other motive. It is easier for attackers to target devices connected to the same internet. Some strategies hackers use are that they create their code from scratch, but other attackers that aren't as experienced just have a log of tools that they can use. I learned that (APT) Advanced Persistent Threat is a class of attacks by state actors that use innovative attack tools to silently extract data over an extended period. Lastly, there are five key elements to creating a practical security strategy: block attacks, update defenses, minimize losses, use layers, and stay alert.
 
**Reflection:**  
Online safety is important because hackers can try to steal personal information. To stay safe, people should use strong, unique passwords and turn on two-factor authentication. Keeping devices and apps updated helps block attacks, and backing up files can prevent data loss. It's also important to be careful about clicking links, opening emails, or visiting suspicous websites. Staying alert can protect personal information every day.
