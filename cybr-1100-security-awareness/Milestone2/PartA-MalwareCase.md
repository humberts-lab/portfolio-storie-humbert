In project 3-1, we learned about downloading and using the Microsoft Safety Scanner. This tool is a free program from Microsoft that can check a computer for viruses and other harmful software. The scanner can also remove some of these threats if it finds them. It is not like regular antivirus software that runs all the time in the background. Instead, it is something you download and run when you need it. Each version of the tool only works for 10 days. You only need to download the newest one to make sure it can find the latest types of malware. This project showed how important it is to have extra tools like this to protect computers.

The Microsoft Safety Scanner can find many different kinds of malware. Some examples are viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, and ransomware. Viruses are pieces of harmful code that attach themselves to files and spread when those files are opened. Worms spread on their own through networks without anyone clicking on them. Trojans pretend to be safe programs, but once they are downloaded, they can cause harm. Spyware hides on a computer and steals information. Ransomware locks up files until money is paid. These types of malware usually get into computers through emails, fake websites, infected downloads, or even USB drives.

If a nursing home got hit with malware, it could be a huge problem. Nursing homes depend on computers to keep track of medical records, schedules, and staff communication. If malware damaged or deleted these files, residents might not get their medicine, and patient information could become unavailable. This could put lives in danger. Malware might also steal financial records like billing or payroll, causing harm to both the nursing home and families. Even small computer problems could slow down staff and break trust between the nursing home and the families who rely on it.

There are several ways nursing homes can protect themselves from malware. First, they could use scanners and antivirus programs regularly to check for infections. Second, staff could be trained on how to spot fake emails or dangerous downloads so they do not let threats in by accident. Computers should always be updated so hackers cannot take advantage of weak spots. Another way to stay safe is to back up all important files so they can be restored if something bad happens. Finally, staff should only have access to the files and programs they need. This way, if one computer gets infected, the malware will not spread as easily.

This project connects to my service learning project because it shows how important it is for nursing home staff to understand basic computer safety. The people working there may not be technology experts, but they are the first line of defense against cyber attacks. Teaching them about tools like Microsoft Safety Scanner can give them confidence and help protect residents' private information. It also shows that simple steps like checking emails carefully and running security scans can prevent bigger problems. Keeping computers safe means keeping residents safe, since health and data care depend on these systems.
