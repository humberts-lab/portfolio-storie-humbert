**What is a Star Topology?** A star topology is the configuration of a network in the shape of a star in which each device is connected to a central node called a hub, switch, etc.

**What devices are included in a star topology?** An end device like a pc, laptop, etc., and a switch connecting them by using copper through cables.

**My steps:**
1. Got out 6 PCs
2. Configured the PCs around the switch placed in the middle
3. Changed the IP Addresses using 192.168.1.1, changing the last number for each 6
4. Tested connectivity
