**Storage Choices in 2025: HDD vs SSD vs SSHD**
- HDD (Hard Disk Drive): Uses spinning disks to store data. Cheap and offers a lot of storage, but it is slower to read/write.
- SSD (Solid State Drive): Uses flash memory (no moving parts). Fast, durable, more expensive per GB.
- SSHD( Solid State Hybrid Drive): Combines HDD and SDD, faster than HDD but slower than a full SDD; more storage for less cost.

In 2025, I would get an SDD out of all the storage choices. It is the most reliable and will make your computer feel much more responsive. It is better for booting, gaming, and everyday use.
