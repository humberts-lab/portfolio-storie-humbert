**Storage Choices in 2025: HDD vs SSD vs SSHD**
- HDD (Hard Disk Drive): Uses spinning disks to store data. Cheap and offers a lot of storage, but it is slower to read/write.
- SSD (Solid State Drive): Uses flash memory (no moving parts). Fast, durable, more expensive per GB.
- SSHD( Solid State Hybrid Drive): Combines HDD and SDD, faster than HDD but slower than a full SDD; more storage for less cost.
